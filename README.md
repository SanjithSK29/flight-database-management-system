The program reads from this file on startup and writes to it whenever a new flight is added or when the application exits.bookings.txt: Stores the records of all bookings. This file is read on startup and updated every time a new booking is made or the application exits.This approach ensures that all data is retained between sessions.How to Compile and RunTo get this system running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.PrerequisitesA C compiler, such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).CompilationOpen your terminal or command prompt.Navigate to the directory where you have saved the jack.c file.Compile the code using the following command:gcc jack.c -o flight_reservation
This command compiles the jack.c source file and creates an executable file named flight_reservation.ExecutionAfter a successful compilation, run the program with this command:./flight_reservation
The program will start, load any existing data from .txt files, and prompt you to register a user before displaying the main menu.Core FunctionalitiesThe main menu provides access to all the system's features.
